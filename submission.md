## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - john_results)/john_results)`.

## Reflections

<!-- I'd love to get 100-200 words on your experience doing the Wedge Project --> 

This project was a super awesome experience. After coming from building models, I didn't realize this side of data was this deep as well. It was a lot of fun trying to get things to run as programatically as possible while still maintaining the quality of the data. Fitting the functions together to clean and store the data was very satisfying when things finally worked. Overall, this has been my favorite project. While I'm not sure how well I did as this was my first experience with data engineering, it was a great learning experience and definitely will be something I want to pursue. This project along with the text mining class have given me many ideas for projects to work on now that I have made my own in house SQL server and NoSQL server.
